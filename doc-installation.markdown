# Installation

Use npm to install yarm, or add yarm to your package.json dependencies.

<div class="highlight"><pre><code><span class="p">$ npm install yarm</span>
</code></pre></div>

yarm has no dependencies, however it is intended to be used with Express and will have additional features if mongoose is present.
